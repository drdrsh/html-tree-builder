# HTML Tree Builder

A very basic HTML tree builder that supports import/export html, I wrote this to help me typeset Arabic HTML document because most editors were not RTL friendly and WYSIWYG editors don't give me the control I needed. You can use this tool to build your HTML, export it and tweak it manually.



```shell
git clone https://github.com/drdrsh/html-tree-builder.git .
npm install
grunt dev
grunt serve
```

And navigate to [http://localhost:9000/index.html](http://localhost:9000/index.html)

To generate distribution files run
```shell
grunt dist
```
